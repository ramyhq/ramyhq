👋 Hi, I’m Ramy Wahid FRESH MOBILE DEVELOPER 👨🏻‍💻 , I have been interested in Mobile Development since college. 👀
unfortunately, I had to go army for 4 years as technical officer, after I started to learn to develop apps with
flutter framework, it was an amazing experience for me to learn such a great framework like FLutter.

🔎 I’m looking for a good chance to work with mobile development team.
